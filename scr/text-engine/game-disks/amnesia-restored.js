I have, at this point, almost no memories of my adult life, though I do retain certain capabilities—such as basic programming skills- and general knowledge. There is also a grab-bag of what I suppose are childhood memories—streets and rooms and cooking smells and a woman's voice softly urging me to go to sleep. My mother's voice? I can remember watching DUMBO and wishing that I had his magic feather. I remember unwrapping a birthday present that had one box inside of another box inside of another box—but I can't remember what was in the last box. It's not safe for me to continue writing. You/I will find what you need to know on the earlier files. I have nothing substantive to add. I'll deposit this in the hotel's safe deposit box and use the password that's keyed to John 1:1. None of the other riddles concern the Bible, by the way, so don't think to find more “clues.” I was able to guess them, so I guess you will, since I'm counting on you to be me.

In the same corner is a round glass topped table with two ice-cream-parlor chairs. The table clearly doubles as a desk, for it is strewn with letters, bills, and contact sheets and glossy prints of photos, just as the sofa doubles as a bed when it is folded out. There is a large walk-in closet facing the entrance of the apartment, its door partly ajar, and another door to the left of that: the bathroom, presumably. There is a dresser to the left of the window, a tv facing the sofa, but the most notable piece of furniture in the room is a baby grand piano, its gleaming ebony lid raised high.
