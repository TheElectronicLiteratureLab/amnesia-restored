American Express insists my records are confidential and can't be divulged over the phone. The WHO'S WHO at the library shows no entry for John Cameron III. The name is probably an alias.

The need for "burying" this information will become evident as you/I continue to access earlier files.

I have, at this point, almost no memories of my adult life, though I do retain certain capabilities--such as basic programming skills- and general knowledge. There is also a grab-bag of what I suppose are childhood memories--streets and rooms and cooking smells and a woman's voice softly urging me to go to sleep. My mother's voice? I can remember watching DUMBO and wishing that I had his magic feather. I remember unwrapping a birthday present that had one box inside of another box inside of another box--but I can't remember what was in the last box. It's not safe for me to continue writing. You/I will find what you need to know on the earlier files. I have nothing substantive to add. I'll deposit this in the hotel's safe deposit box and use the password that's keyed to John 1:1. None of the other riddles concern the Bible, by the way, so don't think to find more “clues.” I was able to guess them, so I guess you will, since I'm counting on you to be me.
